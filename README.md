# Rewrite - Distributed Java Source Refactoring

  **NOTE**: This project has moved to [openrewrite](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) and is no longer maintained here!

The Rewrite project is a refactoring tool for Java source code. It contains a custom Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) supporting
Java 8 language features that encodes the structure and formatting of your source code. The AST is printable to
reconstitute the source code, including its original formatting.
